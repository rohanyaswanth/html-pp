            <li><strong>AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC CONTROL BY STEEL POLES BASED SENSOR NETWORK
                DESIGN IN COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT BASED TRAFFIC LIGHT PROJECT</strong>
                <p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a new class of wireless
                    networks that are becoming very popular with a huge number of
                    civilian and military applications. A wireless sensor network (WSN)
                    is a wireless network that contains distributed independent sensor
                    devices that are meant to monitor physical or environmental
                    conditions. A WSN consists of a set of connected tiny sensor
                    nodes, which communicate with each other and exchange
                    information and data.
